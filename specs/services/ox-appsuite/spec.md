# OX App Suite

## Purpose

Groupware providing email, calendar, address book, and personal task management
with SAML 2.0 authentication, MariaDB backend, Dovecot IMAP backend, and
OX Connector provisioning for academic institutions.

## Scope

This spec defines:
- ✅ **In scope**: OX App Suite groupware deployment, email/calendar/address book/task management, SAML 2.0 authentication, MariaDB backend, Dovecot IMAP backend, OX Connector provisioning for academic institutions
- ❌ **Out of scope**: Alternative groupware (see SOGo), email delivery infrastructure (see dovecot-postfix), advanced email filtering (server-side Sieve rules)

## Non-Goals

- Alternative groupware (see `../sogo/spec.md`)
- Email delivery infrastructure (see dovecot-postfix spec)
- Advanced email filtering (server-side Sieve rules outside scope)

## Depends On

- **MariaDB** (database): Stores persistent groupware data including emails, calendar entries, contacts, tasks
- **Dovecot** (IMAP backend): Provides IMAP email storage and access for email functionality
- **Nubus** (LDAP sync): Provides user and group synchronization for provisioning
- **Keycloak** (authentication): Uses SAML 2.0 for user authentication and attribute mapping
- **OX Connector** (provisioning): Integrates with UCS for groupware account provisioning

## Integrates With

- **Nextcloud** (file sharing): Provides shared file access for email attachments and calendar documents
- **SOGo** (coexistence): Alternative groupware option for different user scenarios
- **Postfix** (mail delivery): Delivers inbound/outbound email via mail infrastructure

## Disaster Recovery

**Tier**: Critical (RPO: 15 min, RTO: 30 min)

**Backup Strategy**:
- **Database** (MariaDB): Hourly incremental + daily full backup, PITR enabled
- **Mail data**: Backed up via Dovecot-Postfix infrastructure
- **OX Connector state**: Daily snapshot
- **Configuration**: GitOps-managed

**Recovery Order**:
1. MariaDB database restore - 15 min
2. OX AppSuite application deployment - 10 min
3. Dovecot IMAP connection verification - 5 min
4. OX Connector deployment - 5 min
5. SAML SP configuration verification - 5 min
6. Nubus LDAP sync verification - 5 min
7. Smoke tests (login, send email, calendar sync) - 10 min
8. User access restoration - 10 min

**Critical Data**:
- User accounts and permissions
- Email folders and messages (via Dovecot)
- Calendar entries and contacts
- OX Connector provisioning state
- SAML SP configuration

**Failure Scenarios**:
- **MariaDB corruption**: Restore from PITR, verify user data integrity
- **OX AppSuite crash**: Kubernetes auto-restart, verify MariaDB connectivity
- **Dovecot failure**: Coordinate with Dovecot-Postfix recovery
- **Complete failure**: Redeploy from GitOps, restore DB, verify all integrations (Dovecot, OX Connector, SAML)
