# Moodle

## Purpose

Plugin-rich learning management system (LMS) providing assignments, workshops,
gradebook, forums, quizzes, SCORM packages, and an extensive plugin ecosystem.
Authenticated via Shibboleth SAML 2.0 SP through Keycloak, deployed as a custom
Docker image (`moodle-shib`) with integrated Shibboleth SP daemon and Apache
web server.

Moodle uses an external database (MariaDB by default), persistent CephFS storage
for course files and user data, and supports backchannel logout via SAML.
The deployment includes volume permission initialization containers and a
dedicated service account for filesystem operations.

## Scope

This spec defines:
- ✅ **In scope**: Moodle LMS deployment, Shibboleth SAML 2.0 authentication, custom Docker image with Shibboleth SP integration, course management, gradebook, forums, quizzes, SCORM support, plugin ecosystem, MariaDB backend, CephFS persistent storage
- ❌ **Out of scope**: Alternative LMS (see ILIAS), Moodle plugin development (see Moodle Plugin Database), custom Moodle theme development, mobile app development

## Non-Goals

- Alternative LMS (see `../ilias/spec.md`)
- Moodle plugin development (see Moodle Plugin Database)
- Custom Moodle theme development

## Requirements

### Requirement: Shibboleth SAML 2.0 authentication

Moodle SHALL authenticate users via Shibboleth SAML 2.0 Service Provider with
SP-initiated SSO through Keycloak. The Shibboleth SP daemon runs alongside
Apache in the same container.

#### Scenario: Student accesses Moodle via portal tile
- GIVEN a student enrolled in Moodle courses
- WHEN the student navigates to the Moodle portal tile in Nubus
- THEN Moodle redirects to Keycloak via Shibboleth SP-initiated SSO
- AND upon authentication, SAML attributes map to the Moodle user profile
- AND the student sees enrolled courses on the Moodle dashboard

#### Scenario: Shibboleth SP configuration
- GIVEN Moodle deployed with Shibboleth SP enabled
- THEN the SP entity ID is `https://moodle.opendesk.<domain>/shibboleth`
- AND the IdP metadata URL is `https://id.opendesk.<domain>/realms/opendesk/protocol/saml/descriptor`
- AND SP configuration is mounted from:
  - ConfigMap `moodle-shibboleth-sp-config` → `/etc/shibboleth` (read-only)
  - Secret `moodle-shibboleth-sp-secret` → `/etc/shibboleth/certs` (read-only)
  - ConfigMap `moodle-apache-shibboleth-config` → `/etc/apache2/conf-enabled/shibboleth.conf` (read-only)

#### Scenario: XML catalog configuration
- GIVEN the Moodle container
- THEN `XML_CATALOG_FILES` is set to Shibboleth/OpenSAML XML catalogs:
  - `/usr/share/xml/shibboleth/catalog.xml`
  - `/usr/share/xml/xmltooling/catalog.xml`
  - `/usr/share/xml/opensaml/saml20-catalog.xml`
  - `/usr/share/xml/opensaml/saml11-catalog.xml`

### Requirement: External database (MariaDB)

Moodle SHALL connect to an external MariaDB database for metadata storage.

#### Scenario: Database connection
- GIVEN the external database configuration
- THEN Moodle connects to `moodle-mariadb:3306`
- AND authenticates as `moodle` user with password from `moodle-database-credentials` secret
- AND the database name is `moodle`

#### Scenario: Database credential rotation
- GIVEN a new password set in the `moodle-database-credentials` secret
- WHEN Moodle's pod restarts
- THEN Moodle reads the new password and reconnects
- AND existing course data is preserved

### Requirement: Persistent file storage

Moodle SHALL persist course files, user uploads, and plugin data on CephFS RWX storage.

#### Scenario: Course file persistence
- GIVEN an instructor uploading course materials (PDFs, videos, SCORM packages)
- WHEN the files are saved in Moodle
- THEN data is stored in the `moodle-data` PVC (mount: `/bitnami/moodle`)
- AND course content survives pod restarts and upgrades

#### Scenario: Storage class selection
- GIVEN the Moodle deployment
- THEN the PVC uses `storageClassNames.RWO` or `persistence.storages.moodle.storageClassName`
- AND access mode is `ReadWriteMany` (shared across replicas)

### Requirement: Multi-replica deployment

Moodle SHALL support multiple replicas for high availability.

#### Scenario: Two replicas active
- GIVEN `replicaCount: 2` (default)
- WHEN the deployment is applied
- THEN 2 Moodle pods run simultaneously
- AND the ingress controller load-balances requests across replicas
- AND both pods share the same PVC (RWX required)

### Requirement: Initial setup and installation

Moodle SHALL support automated installation on first deployment.

#### Scenario: Fresh installation
- GIVEN `MOODLE_SKIP_INSTALL: "false"` (default)
- WHEN the first pod starts
- THEN Moodle runs the installer
- AND creates the admin account with `MOODLE_USERNAME`/`MOODLE_PASSWORD`
- AND configures the site name `MOODLE_SITE_NAME`

#### Scenario: Skip installation on existing deployment
- GIVEN `MOODLE_SKIP_INSTALL: "true"`
- WHEN the pod starts

- AND connects directly to the existing database

### Requirement: Security context

Moodle SHALL run as a non-root user with dropped capabilities.

#### Scenario: Container security
- GIVEN the Moodle deployment
- THEN `runAsUser: 1001`, `runAsGroup: 1001`
- AND `fsGroup: 1001`
- AND `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`, `privileged: false`, `runAsNonRoot: true`
- AND all capabilities are dropped (`ALL`)
- AND `seccompProfile: RuntimeDefault`

### Requirement: Health probes

Moodle SHALL expose liveness and readiness probes on port 80.

#### Scenario: Liveness probe
- GIVEN Moodle deployed and running
- THEN a TCP liveness probe on port 80 with 30s initial delay and 10s period
- AND unhealthy pods are restarted

#### Scenario: Readiness probe
- GIVEN Moodle deployed and running
- THEN a TCP readiness probe on port 80 with 5s initial delay and 5s period
- AND pods are removed from service when not ready

### Requirement: Ingress configuration

Moodle SHALL be accessible via HAProxy ingress with TLS and large file upload support.

#### Scenario: HTTPS access with large uploads
- GIVEN Moodle behind HAProxy ingress
- THEN `ssl-redirect: "true"` enforces HTTPS
- AND `proxy-body-size: "200M"` allows large course file uploads
- AND `timeout-server: "300s"` and `timeout-client: "300s"` allow slow uploads

## SLO

**Tier**: High (widely-used LMS, critical for course delivery)

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Availability** | 99.5% (3.6 hours downtime/month max) | Uptime over 30-day window |
| **Latency (P95)** | <500ms (page load) | Apache access log analysis |
| **Latency (P95)** | <1s (quiz submission) | PHP-FPM response time metrics |
| **Error Rate** | <0.5% (HTTP 5xx) | Apache access log analysis |
| **SSO Success** | >99% (Shibboleth auth) | Keycloak event log |

**Alerts**:
- Moodle 5xx error rate >1% for 10 minutes → P2 alert
- Login failures >5% for 5 minutes → P1 alert
- PHP-FPM response time >2s for 15 minutes → P3 alert
- Database connection pool exhausted → P2 alert
- Cron job failures (3+ consecutive) → P3 alert

**Capacity**:
- 10,000 concurrent users (exam periods)
- 50,000 quiz submissions per hour (peak)
- 100,000 course page views per hour
- Database: 20 GB (typical), 200 GB (large institution)

## Disaster Recovery

**Tier**: High (RPO: 30 min, RTO: 2 hours)

**Backup Strategy**:
- **Database** (MariaDB): Hourly incremental + daily full backup, PITR enabled
- **Course files** (CephFS): Daily snapshot
- **Moodle data directory**: Daily snapshot
- **Configuration**: GitOps-managed

**Recovery Order**:
1. Database restore (MariaDB) - 20 min
2. CephFS course files verification - 15 min
3. Moodle data directory restore - 15 min
4. Moodle application deployment (custom Docker image) - 10 min
5. Shibboleth SP configuration verification - 5 min
6. Cron job resumption - 5 min
7. Plugin re-installation and verification - 15 min
8. Smoke tests (login, course access, quiz submission) - 10 min

**Critical Data**:
- Course content and structure
- User submissions, grades, and quiz attempts
- Forum posts and collaborative content
- Moodle data directory (cached files, temp uploads)
- Plugin configurations

**Failure Scenarios**:
- **Database corruption**: Restore from PITR, verify user data integrity
- **CephFS storage loss**: Restore from snapshots, verify course material checksums
- **Custom Docker image broken**: Rebuild image, redeploy, verify Shibboleth integration
- **Complete failure**: Redeploy from GitOps, restore DB + files, re-register Shibboleth SP
