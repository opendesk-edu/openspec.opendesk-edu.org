# CryptPad

## Purpose

End-to-end encrypted collaborative editor for diagram documents, accessed
through Nextcloud integration. CryptPad provides E2E encryption at the
application layer — the server cannot read document content. Supports diagram
editing (diagram pad type) with registration restricted to authenticated access
only.

## Scope

This spec defines:
- ✅ **In scope**: End-to-end encrypted diagram editing via Nextcloud integration, authenticated access (registration restricted), client-side encryption, document persistence via Nextcloud
- ❌ **Out of scope**: Standalone deployment (integration-only), rich text/code/slide/spreadsheet pads (diagram only), public pad sharing (registration restricted), server-side document storage (Nextcloud-managed)

## Non-Goals

- Standalone document editing outside Nextcloud (integration-only deployment)
- Rich text/code/slide/spreadsheet pads (diagram only in openDesk)
- Public pad sharing (registration restricted prevents this)
- Server-side document storage (persistence is Nextcloud-managed)

## Depends On

- **Nextcloud** (integration platform): Provides user authentication, document storage, and seamless editing integration
- **Keycloak** (authentication): Uses opaque OAuth2 tokens for secure user authentication
- **Redis** (session storage): Stores session tokens and pad metadata
- **CephFS/HDD** (storage): Provides shared storage for CryptPad data persistence

## Integrates With

- **Nextcloud** (document editing): Seamless integration for diagram document editing within Nextcloud interface
- **Keycloak** (SSO): Provides single sign-on authentication via OAuth2

## Requirements

### Requirement: Encrypted diagram editing via Nextcloud

CryptPad SHALL edit diagram documents within Nextcloud with end-to-end
encryption and seamless integration.

#### Scenario: User edits diagram in Nextcloud
- GIVEN a user opening a `.cryptpad-diagram` file in Nextcloud
- WHEN the user clicks to edit
- THEN CryptPad loads within Nextcloud via Nextcloud Cryptpad app
- AND the document is decrypted client-side via encrypted blob
- AND server cannot read document content (E2E encryption)
- AND changes are saved to Nextcloud disk, encrypted
- AND deactivating public access would break Nextcloud plugin (must remain enabled)

#### Scenario: Nextcloud Cryptpad app document storage
- GIVEN a CryptPad diagram document edited in Nextcloud
- WHEN the user saves changes
- THEN the encrypted document blob is stored in Nextcloud S3 storage
- AND file path is `https://nextcloud.opendesk.hrz.uni-marburg.edu/apps/cryptpaddiagram`
- AND Nextcloud metadata includes pad ID, version, last modified timestamp
- AND Nextcloud serves the file via `GET /apps/cryptpaddiagram/` endpoint

#### Scenario: Encryption key management
- GIVEN a CryptPad document encrypted with user-specific key
- WHEN the document is created in CryptPad
- THEN encryption key is generated client-side (random 256-bit)
- AND key is never sent to server (client-side only)
- AND key is stored in Nextcloud user preferences (encrypted)
- AND key sharing with collaborators relies on Nextcloud share mechanism

### Requirement: Registration restriction

CryptPad SHALL restrict new user registration to prevent anonymous access
and ensure only authenticated Nextcloud users can access pads.

#### Scenario: Registration blocked for anonymous users
- GIVEN `restrictRegistration: true` in CryptPad configuration
- WHEN an unauthenticated user tries to create an account directly
- THEN registration form returns error: "Registration disabled"
- AND error message redirects: "Please access via Nextcloud"
- AND only authenticated users (via Nextcloud session header) can create pads

#### Scenario: Nextcloud session delegation
- GIVEN a user logged into Nextcloud

- AND CryptPad validates session via Nextcloud API (`OC-SessionId`, `OC-UserId`)
- AND CryptPad creates anonymous pad (no registration required)
- AND pad creation timestamps user auth via headers

#### Scenario: Multi-user collaborative editing
- GIVEN a CryptPad diagram document shared with multiple Nextcloud users
- WHEN users edit simultaneously

- AND Operational Transformation (OT) algorithm handles concurrent edits
- AND each user sees changes in real-time (< 200ms latency)
- AND cursor positions are synchronized across users

### Requirement: Stateless storage

CryptPad SHALL run without persistent storage by default, relying on Nextcloud
for document persistence.

#### Scenario: No PVC required

- THEN encrypted pads are NOT stored locally in the pod
- AND all pad data is stored in Nextcloud S3 or CephFS
- AND pod restarts are fast (no file system sync delay)
- AND HPA can scale replicas without data consistency concerns

#### Scenario: Nextcloud-managed persistence
- GIVEN a CryptPad diagram document edited multiple times
- WHEN versions accumulate
- THEN Nextcloud stores each version with version history
- AND CryptPad relies on Nextcloud's file versioning
- AND old versions can be restored via Nextcloud UI
- AND CryptPad does not need to manage version history

- AND new replicas are ready to serve requests within 30 seconds
- AND load balancer distributes traffic across replicas
- AND autoscaling events trigger Prometheus alerts

#### Scenario: Scale down on low load
- GIVEN HPA configured with `targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 70`
- WHEN CPU usage drops below 50% for 15 minutes
- THEN replicas are terminated (down to min 2 replicas)
- AND existing connections drain gracefully (no session drops)
- AND scale-down respects `scaleDown: stabilizationWindowSeconds: 60`

#### Scenario: Resource limits and requests
- GIVEN CryptPad deployment with defined resources
- THEN container memory: `256Mi` (limit 512Mi), CPU: `250m` (limit 500m)
- AND replica count: 3 by default (per HPA config)
- AND pod disruption budget: `min available: 50%`
- AND OOMKiller prioritizes terminating idle replicas first

### Requirement: Security and isolation

CryptPad SHALL run with minimal privileges and container security hardening.

#### Scenario: Non-root container
- GIVEN CryptPod deployment with security context

**Critical Data**:
- Pad metadata (stored in Redis)
- Pad data (stored in CephFS, E2E encrypted)
- OIDC client configuration

**Failure Scenarios**:
- **Redis corruption**: Restore from snapshot, verify pad metadata
- **CephFS storage loss**: Restore from snapshot, verify E2E encryption integrity
- **Nextcloud integration broken**: Verify WOPI/Nextcloud configuration
- **Complete failure**: Redeploy from GitOps, restore Redis + CephFS, verify Nextcloud integration
